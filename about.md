This is Kunlei Lian. I am currently working at WalmartLabs as Data Scientist - Operations Research, focusing on supply chain optimization. I graduated from [University of Arkansas](www.uark.edu) in 2017 with Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering. My dissertation centers on service consistency in vehicle routing. Prior to that, I got my Masters and Bachelors degrees from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](www.hust.edu.cn) in 2012 and 2009, respectively. My areas of interest lie in operations research and programming.
